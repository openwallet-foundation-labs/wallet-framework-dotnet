## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for payments is mandated under [PSD2]  Article 97 (1) for electronic payment initiation, as well as for accessing a payment account online or other User's actions that present a risk of fraud. By design, the EUDI Wallet supports all three authentication factor categories required by [PSD2] (knowledge, possession, inherence) to enable SCA, as well as Dynamic Linking.

To ensure interoperability, a set of requirements is specified for the implementation of SCA using the Wallet. This technical specification is based on the discussion within Topics W and AA.

### 1.2 Scope of the Document

The [ARF] Section 2.6.4 introduces the concept of dedicated SUA Attestations issued into the User's Wallet Unit by their ASPSP and then later presented in conjunction with transactional data to be signed by the Wallet Unit (for Dynamic Linking).

In general, this specification aims to define the behaviour of the Wallet Units when receiving a presentation request of attributes from a SUA Attestation used for SCA (hereinafter called "SCA Attestation"). Therefore, the Wallet Solution Providers shall implement their Wallet Solutions in compliance with this document.

At the same time, the related SCA Attestation Rulebooks, delivered by the financial sector, provide all the necessary information and requirements for:

- Attestation Providers (Payment Service Providers, such as banks) to issue their SCA Attestations,
- Relying Parties (Payment Service Providers or other payment actors, such as Payees or Payment Initiation Service Providers) to make  presentation requests of the SCA Attestation, as payment transaction authentication.
Therefore the Attestation Providers and Relying Parties shall also follow a related SCA Attestation Rulebook.

This document contains:

- overview of the SCA scenarios at stake,
- minimum requirements and specifications for transactional data sent in a presentation request,
- minimum requirements and specifications for metadata of the SCA Attestation,
- transactional data processing and display message rendering requirements,
- other necessary requirements related to Wallet Solutions' functionality, interoperability or security.

This document is complemented by related SCA Attestation Rulebooks, that may specify:

- SCA Attestation types, applicable in various contexts,
- full specification of attributes of SCA Attestations,
- extended specifications of metadata of SCA Attestations,
- extended specifications of transactional data transported by the presentation protocol,
- extended display messages rendering rules,
- other requirements such as policies for SCA Attestation Providers or Relying Parties.

This document provides the minimum necessary requirements and specifications for the basic SCA flow, to be supported by all the Wallet Solutions. Therefore, the SCA Attestation Rulebooks shall be created in conformity with this specification.
The SCA Attestation Rulebooks may provide additional requirements and specifications extending this document (for instance to improve user experience or customise the scenarios) that may be implemented by Wallet Solutions on a voluntary basis.  

This version of the document focuses on [SD-JWT-VC] format and [OID4VP] presentation protocol only.

### 1.3 Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**",  "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they are written in all capital letters.

## 2 High-level Solution Design

_**Note**: This chapter is **informative**. It aims to help the reader to understand the context for this specification. All the possible scenarios and flows supported by this specification may be described in a related SCA Attestation Rulebook._  

### 2.1 Process Flows

On a high level, the solution is composed of the following parts:

- **Registration**: The secure association of the Wallet Unit and Holder with the Account Holder by means of the Payer's PSP issuing a dedicated, cryptographically bound SCA Attestation into the User's Wallet Unit. This step is not described in this document.
- **Authentication**: The Strong Customer Authentication at time of transaction by means of presenting the SCA Attestation.
- **Dynamic Linking**: Linking of the User's consent to a specific transaction by means of including transaction-specific information in the presentation request and (signed) response.

Using an EUDI Wallet for SCA in general can happen in one of two operating setups:

- In the first setup, the Wallet Unit is presenting the SCA Attestation back to the Attestation Provider, usually the User's PSP (or an Intermediary on their behalf). The User may be entirely in the context of their PSP (e.g., interacting with their online/mobile banking to send a credit transfer) or he/she may have been redirected from a third party (e.g., a Merchant or a TPP) to the PSP's environment. When used like this, the EUDIW resembles banks' existing authenticator solutions. We refer to this setup as the "**Issuer-requested flow**".
- In the second setup, the Wallet Unit is presenting the SCA Attestation to a third party which is not the User's PSP (or an Intermediary on their behalf). We refer to this setup as the "**Third-party-requested flow**". It is driven by two constellations:
  - As per [PSD2], the User may give consent to execute a payment not only directly towards their PSP, but also via the Payee (or an Intermediary on their behalf). When used like this, the EUDIW loosely resembles an xPay wallet functionality.
  - The integration models for TPPs such as PISPs and AISPs know a variant called "embedded SCA flow" where the User provides authentication information via the TPP to the ASPSP.

In a Third-party-requested flow, additional communication needs to take place between the third party and the ASPSP to execute the action. This usually happens over existing payment or Open Banking networks and is beyond the scope of this document.

It is expected that SCA Attestation Providers utilise different SCA Attestation types for the Issuer-requested vs. Third-party-requested flows to benefit from the more stringent handling of Embedded Disclosure Policies as defined in this specification for relevant SCA applications in the first setup. SCA Attestation Providers may further provide different SCA Attestation types to represent (a) the User or (b) a specific account or card belonging to a given User with that attestation, according to their needs.

### 2.2 SUA Attestations for SCA

An SUA Attestation for SCA purposes (hereinafter called "SCA Attestation") is an attestation issued by a PSP into a Wallet Unit that serves as a verifiable digital proof that the Wallet Unit is associated with a specific Payer and, if applicable, their account or card managed by the PSP.

In the financial services ecosystem, data structures differ between payment methods. Therefore, there will be multiple types of SCA Attestations. The structures of the SCA Attestations to be used in conjunction with this specification are to be specified in related SCA Attestation Rulebooks.

The following is a minimal, non-normative example of an SCA Attestation that represents a card belonging to a given User:

```json

    "iss": "https://issuer.superbank1.com",
    "aud": "https://rp.superbank1.com",

```

The following is a minimal, non-normative example of an SCA Attestation that represents an account belonging to a given User:

The following is a minimal, non-normative example of an SCA Attestation that just represents a User:

```json

            "y": "ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZZ"
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3 SCA Attestation Metadata

An SCA Attestation can be requested for various transaction types, such as logging into online banking or confirming a payment. To prevent fraudulent abuse, Attestation Providers must be able to control which combinations of transaction types and SCA Attestation types are permitted (e.g., for Issuer-requested vs. Third-party-requested flow variants). To enable this control, this specification extends the standard SD-JWT Verifiable Credential (VC) type metadata functionality of [SD-JWT-VC].

This specification introduces a `transaction_data_types` parameter to the [SD-JWT-VC] type metadata. This parameter contains an entry for each permitted transaction data type associated with a given SCA Attestation type. Each entry, in turn, contains information that defines how to process different aspects of the transaction type when presenting an SCA Attestation.

These aspects comprise the following:

- **Transaction data schema**: [JSON Schema] describing the data structure of the transactional data's content.
- **Localisation of the data schema**: JSON object containing localisation strings for the data fields of the transactional data.
- **Visualisation**: A visualisation hierarchy level indicating the importance of individual elements of the transactional data.
- **Wallet UI Elements**: JSON object containing localisation strings for different UI elements used by the wallet during a transaction.

The JSON schema and data objects can be embedded or referenced by URI. In case of URNs (non-resolvable), the Wallet Solution recognises them through this or another specification it adheres to. In case of URLs (resolvable), the Wallet Unit will resolve the address to obtain and process the data from that location.

Attestation Providers are expected to use collision-resistant identifiers for transaction data types. The method for communicating these identifiers to the party assembling the transactional data (e.g., the RP) is beyond the scope of this document. It is expected that sector-specific standardisation bodies or schemes will provide this governance and/or offer automated services for RPs.

The following is a non-normative example of an SCA Attestation type metadata:

```json
{
    "vct": "https://pay.example.com/card",
    "name": "pay.example Payment Credential",
    "description": "This is a pay.example Payment Credential",
    "extends": "https://pay.example.com/basic-schema-1.2",
    "schema_uri": "https://pay.example.com/card-schema-1.0",
    "transaction_data_types": {
        "https://standardsbody.org/eudiw-trx/payment": {
            "schema": "urn:eudi:sca:payment:1",
            "claims": [
                {
                    "path": [ "payload", "transaction_id"],
                    "visualisation": 4,
                    "display": [
                        {
                            "lang": "de-DE",
                            "label": "Transaktionsnummer",
                            "description": "Eindeutige Nummer der Transaktion"
                        },
                        {
                            "lang": "en-GB",
                            "label": "Transaction ID",
                            "description": "Unique identifier of the transaction"
                        }
                    ]
                }
                ...
            ],
            "ui_labels_uri" : "https://pay.example.com/ui-localisation-catalogue.json"
        }
    }
}
```

The detailed specification for these parameters is located in Section 4. An SCA Attestation Rulebook may specify additional parameters for optional support by Wallet Solutions.

The SCA Attestation Provider shall publish the metadata parameters in accordance with the specification provided in [SD-JWT-VC].

### 2.4 Standardised Transaction Data

To foster interoperability between wallet providers and banks, this specification defines the data schemas for basic transaction types every Wallet Unit needs to support in terms of rendering and processing in order to accommodate the following use cases:

- payment confirmation,
- login and confirmation of actions carrying a risk of fraud or abuse,
- accessing payment account information, and
- e-mandates for Payee-initiated transactions.

To do so, this specification introduces and standardises a `payload` object under [OID4VP]'s `transaction_data`.

## 3 Presentation Request Processing

For the Wallet Unit to determine whether a given attestation is an SCA Attestation, it **SHALL** evaluate the SD-JWT VC Type Metadata as per [SD-JWT-VC] section 6. If the VC Type Metadata contains a top-level claim `category` with the value `urn:eu:europa:ec:eudi:sua:sca`, it **SHALL** process the attestation as SCA Attestation according to this specification.

The following is a non-normative example of the VC Type Metadata including the `category` claim:

```json
{
    "vct": "https://pay.example.com/card",
    "name": "pay.example Payment Credential",
    "description": "This is a pay.example Payment Credential",
    "extends": "https://pay.example.com/basic-schema-1.2",
    "schema_uri": "https://pay.example.com/card-schema-1.0",
    "category": "urn:eu:europa:ec:eudi:sua:sca"
}
```

### 3.1 Embedded Disclosure Policy and Signed Request Verification

SCA Attestation providers are **RECOMMENDED** to make use of embedded disclosure policies, as specified in the [ARF]. Details are to be specified in an SCA Attestation Rulebook.

Relying Parties sending a presentation request for an SCA Attestation **SHOULD** use signed "Authorization Requests" as specified in [OID4VP] and [HAIP] section 5.

Upon receiving a presentation request, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** perform the following verifications:

1. **Disclosure Policy Verification**: If the SCA Attestation includes an embedded disclosure policy, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** evaluate it to verify that the presentation request was sent by a permitted Relying Party. If this verification fails, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** cease processing the request and inform the User.

2. **Signed Request Verification**: The Wallet Unit **SHALL** check if the "Authorization Request" is signed.
    - If it is signed, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** verify the signature and certificate. If this verification fails, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** cease processing the request and inform the User.
    - If the request is not signed, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** warn the User and require explicit confirmation before continuing to process the request.

### 3.2 Transactional Data Discovery and Validation

To ensure compatibility, Relying Parties **SHALL** only use transaction types and schemas that are specified in the `transaction_data_types` parameter of the SCA Attestation's type metadata.

Upon receiving a presentation request containing a `transaction_data` object for a specific attestation type, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** perform the following validation steps:
1. Verify that the requested attestation type is an SCA Attestation of the `category` `urn:eu:europa:ec:eudi:sua:sca`.
2. Verify that the `transaction_data.type` (e.g., `https://standardsbody.org/eudiw-trx/payment`) is a key in the `transaction_data_types` map found in the SCA Attestation's type metadata.
3. Retrieve the corresponding schema URI from the `schema` property for that transaction type.
4. Validate that the `transaction_data.payload` object conforms to the [JSON Schema] referenced by the retrieved URI, or to one of the built-in transaction data types described in Section 4.2.
5. If any of these verifications fail, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** cease processing the request and inform the User with an appropriate error message.
6. If all verifications pass, the Wallet Unit **MAY** continue processing the presentation request.

The SCA Attestation metadata **SHALL** contain all the mandatory data elements specified in Section 4.1 and **MAY** contain additional elements specified in a related SCA Attestation Rulebook.

### 3.3 Transactional Data Processing

The transactional data are processed for the following purposes:

- display message(s) rendering,
- User consent proof generation and delivery,
- other purposes not related to the two above, as specified in this document.

#### 3.3.1 Display Message Rendering

When requesting User consent for an SCA Attestation presentation, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** render a display message composed of three main sources of data elements:

1. **Attributes to be Presented**: This includes all attributes requested from the SCA Attestation and any other attestations. The rendering for this data **SHALL** follow the general presentation rules specified in the [ARF] (as for presentations not involving transactional data). In case the Attestation Provider uses the `display` functionality for `credential_metadata` as defined in [OID4VCI] or the `display` metadata as defined in [SD-JWT-VC], the Wallet Unit **SHALL** adhere to these instructions.
2. **Transactional Data**: This includes all parameters from the `payload` object within the `transaction_data`. The rendering for this group **SHALL** follow the rules specified in this document.
3. **UI Labels**: This includes the localised labels for the UI elements introduced in this specification.

Wallet Solutions **SHALL** ensure that Users are able to give explicit and informed consent to a transaction. The Wallet Unit **SHALL** therefore display transactional data (or parts of it, see below) in conjunction with the requested attributes of the SCA Attestation to the User in a clear, understandable and accurate manner for review before obtaining the User's confirmation for the transaction. The Wallet Unit **SHALL** populate the UI Elements specified in Section 3.3.3 with the (localised) labels provided in the SCA Attestation type's metadata. In case the transactional data's localised parameter names or the required UI elements' localised labels are not available to the Wallet Unit at the time of transaction, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** cease processing the transaction and inform the User.

For transaction data, this specification defines hierarchy levels of visual importance that **SHALL** be implemented by Wallet Solutions. SCA Attestation Providers are **RECOMMENDED** to set these levels for leaf parameter names and their values within the `payload` object through the `visualisation` parameter of the Transaction Data Claim Metadata as introduced in Section 3.3.2. 

The levels are:

- `1`: The parameter name and value **MUST** be _prominently_ displayed on the main transaction confirmation screen.
- `2`: The parameter name and value **MUST** be displayed on the main transaction confirmation screen.
- `3`: The parameter name and value **MUST** be displayed, but **MAY** be displayed on a supplementary or subsequent transaction confirmation screen, including where User action is needed to invoke this screen.
- `4`: The parameter name and value **MAY** be omitted from being displayed on the transaction confirmation screen(s).

In case no `visualisation` level is set in the metadata for a given leaf parameter, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** apply a default value of `3`.

SCA Attestation Rulebooks **MAY** permit to visualise parameter names as icons or to have them omitted from being displayed if the User can easily understand the nature of the parameter from the parameter value itself. Wallet Solutions **SHALL** therefore support the generic functionality to show icons instead of parameter names or to omit them from being displayed.

The Wallet Unit **MAY** comply with any additional display rendering requirements contained in an SCA Attestation Rulebook.

#### 3.3.2 Transaction Data Claim Metadata

The SCA Attestation type metadata **MUST** also supply metadata for each claim of the transaction data object payload in the same manner as it is specified in the section "Claim Metadata" of [SD-JWT-VC] using the `claims` parameter. The claim metadata **MUST** be used to provide human readable labels and descriptions in multiple languages and also a hierarchy level for the visual representation on the confirmation screen.

This specification extends the Claim Metadata of [SD-JWT-VC] by the following parameter:  

- `visualisation`: **OPTIONAL** (Integer) A hierarchy level between 1 and 4 for visual representation on the confirmation screen.

The `sd` parameter is not applicable in the case of Transaction Data Claim Metadata.

#### 3.3.3 UI Elements Catalogue

The localisation catalogue for UI elements is a JSON object that provides localised strings for the following UI components used during a transaction. If provided, Wallet Solutions **SHALL** label these UI elements with the respective value.

- **`affirmative_action_label`**: **REQUIRED** The label for the UI element used to confirm or consent to the action (e.g., "Confirm Payment").
- **`denial_action_label`**: **OPTIONAL** The label for the UI element used to deny or cancel the action (e.g., "Cancel Payment"). In the absence of this element the Wallet Solution **SHALL** define a label for the UI element to deny or cancel the action.
- **`transaction_title`**: **OPTIONAL** A title/headline for the transaction confirmation screen which the Wallet Unit displays to the User. In the absence of this element the Wallet Solution **MAY** define a title.
- **`security_hint`**: **OPTIONAL** A security hint to be displayed to the User. In the absence of this element the Wallet Unit **SHALL NOT** display the security hint.

Additional UI elements identifiers **MAY** be defined if supported by a Wallet Solution.

The catalogue **SHALL** be provided by the Attestation Provider as a list of key-value pairs with the following structure:

- **Key**: UI element identifier
- **Value**: An array of objects, where each object **SHALL** contain:
  - `lang`: A language identifier as defined in [RFC5646].
  - `value`: The localised string for the specified language. The following maximum string lengths apply for the elements defined in this specification:
    - `affirmative_action_label`: 30 characters,
    - `denial_action_label`: 30 characters,
    - `transaction_title`: 50 characters,
    - `security_hint`: 250 characters.

This catalogue is either referenced by the `ui_labels_uri` parameter or included in the `ui_labels` parameter in the SCA Attestation Transaction type metadata.

The following is a non-normative example of an UI elements localisation catalogue object:

```json
{
    "affirmative_action_label": [
        {
            "lang": "de",
            "value": "Zahlung bestätigen"
        },

### 3.4 Combined Presentation

Relying Parties may request attributes from multiple attestations in a single presentation request.
Therefore a presentation request can combine attributes from an SCA Attestation and other (non-SCA) attestations, enabling combination of payments and additional attributes presentation. Examples for such use cases could be payment plus age verification, driver's licence or loyalty cards.
The Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL) allows the Relying Party to specify a combination of various (non-SCA Attestation related) attributes to facilitate the payment transaction. The details and examples on making DCQL queries in combined presentation requests **MAY** be presented in an SCA Attestation Rulebook.

### 3.5 Presentation Request Encryption

The SCA Attestation presentation request may carry (sensitive) personal data contained within the transactional data. To mitigate risks related to privacy, it is **RECOMMENDED** for Relying Parties to use encrypted presentation requests.
Therefore, the Wallet Units **SHALL** support processing of encrypted presentation requests in compliance with [JAR] and [OID4VP] Section 5.10.

### 3.6 Presentation Response

After the User gives consent, the Wallet Unit **SHALL** provide a response according to [OID4VP] and [HAIP]. This includes handling the `nonce` and `aud` claims as described in sections B.1.3.1.5 and B.3.6 of [OID4VP] v1.0.

The presentation of an SCA Attestation in the [SD-JWT-VC] format **SHALL** include a Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT) to ensure cryptographic binding between the User's action and the transaction, and to guarantee the freshness and uniqueness of the presentation.

In addition to the standard claims, this specification defines the following claims for the KB-JWT:

- **`jti`**: **REQUIRED** A fresh, cryptographically random value with sufficient entropy, as defined in [RFC7519], section 4.1.7. This value **SHALL** be unique for each presentation. Once verified, it serves as the Authentication Code required by [PSD2] for electronic payments.
- **`response_mode`**: **REQUIRED** The value of the `response_mode` parameter given in the [OID4VP] Authorization Request. The value may be used to evaluate the [OID4VP] implementation of a Relying Part in case the Presentation is used in a Third-party-requested flow.
- **`amr`**: **REQUIRED** Authentication Methods References. A JSON array that documents the authentication factors successfully applied by the Wallet Unit to authorize the presentation. This is required to satisfy the traceability requirements of the [PSD2] Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS).

The `amr` array **SHALL** contain at least two different objects representing authentication categories. Each object consists of a key representing the category and a value specifying the method used. The following keys and values are defined by this specification:

- **`knowledge`**:
  - `pin_less_than_6_digits`
  - `pin_6_or_more_digits`
  - `passphrase_less_than_8_chars`
  - `passphrase_8_to_11_chars`
  - `passphrase_12_or_more_chars`
  - `pattern`
  - `other`
- **`possession`**:
  - `key_in_remote_wscd`
  - `key_in_local_external_wscd`
  - `key_in_local_internal_wscd`
  - `key_in_local_native_wscd`
  - `other`
- **`inherence`**:
  - `fingerprint_device`
  - `fingerprint_external`
  - `face_device`
  - `face_external`
  - `other`

The `iat` (issued at) claim of the KB-JWT **MAY** be used by a Relying Party to restrict the timeframe in which the SCA result is accepted.

The following is a non-normative example of the KB-JWT object:

```json
{
    "aud": "x509_san_dns:shop.example.com",
    "iat": 1741269093,
    "jti": "deeec2b0-3bea-4477-bd5d-e3462a709481",
    "nonce": "bUtJdjJESWdmTWNjb011YQ",
    "sd_hash": "Re-CtLZfjGLErKy3eSriZ4bBx3AtUH5Q5wsWiiWKIwY",
    "amr": [
        {"knowledge": "passphrase_less_than_8_chars"},
        {"inherence": "fingerprint_device"}
    ],
    "transaction_data_hashes": [
        "OJcnQQByvV1iTYxiQQQx4dact-TNnSG-Ku_cs_6g55Q"
    ],
    "transaction_data_hashes_alg": "sha-256"
}
```

## 4 Data Elements and Structures

### 4.1 SCA Attestation VC Type Metadata Schema

This section defines the claims for SCA Attestation's metadata in addition to the claims specified for SD-JWT VC Type Metadata in [SD-JWT-VC].

- **`category`**: **OPTIONAL** (string) Category the attestation belongs to. **MAY** be used to indicate to the Wallet Unit that the attestation needs to be processed as the SCA Attestation.
- **`transaction_data_types`**: **REQUIRED** (string) An object containing a list of key/value pairs:
  - **`key`**: **REQUIRED** (string) URI that identifies the type of a `transaction_data` object as defined by OpenID4VP that **MAY** be used during the presentation of the given SCA Attestation.
  - **`value`**: **REQUIRED** (object)
    - **`schema`**: **CONDITIONAL** (string) Embedded [JSON Schema] defining the structure of the `payload` object within the `transaction_data` object of a given type. **MUST NOT** be used if `schema_uri` is present.
    - **`schema_uri`**: **CONDITIONAL** (string) URI that references a [JSON Schema] defining the structure of the `payload` object within the `transaction_data` object of a given type. **MUST NOT** be used if `schema` is present.
    - **`claims`**: **CONDITIONAL** Array of objects containing information about particular claims for displaying and validating the claims according to section 3.3.3. **MUST NOT** be used if `claims_uri` is present.
    - **`claims_uri`**: **CONDITIONAL** URI that references a JSON document containing an array of objects containing information about particular claims for displaying and validating the claims according to section 3.3.3. **MUST NOT** be used if `claims` is present.
    - **`ui_labels`**: **CONDITIONAL** Embedded JSON document containing a catalogue of string identifiers and their localised values for UI elements, such as buttons, used in the context of the transaction. **MUST NOT** be used if `ui_labels_uri` is present.
    - **`ui_labels_uri`**: **CONDITIONAL** URI that references a JSON document containing a catalogue of string identifiers and their localised values for UI elements, such as buttons, used in the context of the transaction. **MUST NOT** be used if `ui_labels` is present.

#### 4.1.1 Retrieving Metadata

Wallet Unit SHALL support metadata retrieval methods as specified in section 6.3.1. and 6.3.4. of [SD-JWT-VC].

#### 4.1.2 Metadata Integrity Verification

Section 7 of [SD-JWT-VC] introduces a mechanism for Wallet Units to verify the integrity of external metadata files referenced within an SCA Attestation. It is **RECOMMENDED** for SCA Attestation Providers to include this integrity mechanism in their SCA Attestations.

If this mechanism is used, the SCA Attestation Provider **SHALL** include a hash value of the referenced metadata file within the SCA Attestation claim. This claim **SHALL** be suffixed with the `#integrity` designator (e.g., `vct#integrity`). To address individual elements within the transaction data types array, the bracket notation`[]` **SHALL** be used.

If an SCA Attestation includes any `#integrity` suffixed claims, Wallet Unit **SHALL** verify the integrity of the retrieved document by comparing the calculated hash of the retrieved document against the value of the respective `#integrity` suffixed claim, as defined in section 7 of [SD-JWT-VC].

Wallet Unit **MAY** omit from displaying to User claims suffixed with `#integrity`.

The inclusion of the `#integrity` claims dictates that any modification to the SCA Attestation's type metadata will cause a negative result of the integrity check, thereby invalidating the existing SCA Attestation. In consequence, re-issuance of the SCA attestation is necessary.

Non-normative example for an SD-JWT VC payload including integrity claims for the transaction data type array:

```json
{
    "iss": "https://issuer.superbank3.com",
    "sub": "37774a3f-ab14-43c3-96bc-bb1066a30a1d",
    ...
    "vct": "https://psd2.standard.org/payment_service_user",
    "vct#integrity": "sha256-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-..5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-WRL5",
    "transaction_data_types['https://standardsbody.org/eudiw-trx/payment'].schema_uri#integrity": "sha256-e3b0c44298fc49afbf4...a495991852b855",
    "transaction_data_types['https://standardsbody.org/eudiw-trx/payment'].ui_labels_uri#integrity": "sha256-335f3750519114d2a93...5e6ed24c30c0317"
    ...
}
```

### 4.2 Transactional Data Object

The transactional data is a JSON object contained in the `transaction_data` parameter of an [OID4VP] request. This section defines the structure and minimum set of parameters of transactional data objects.

This specification extends the `transaction_data` object defined in [OID4VP] by adding a `payload` parameter. This parameter is an object with the transaction details, and its structure is defined by the [JSON Schema] referenced in the `schema` parameter of the SCA Attestation type metadata.
